* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
* 'test/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 2 to 24.

===================

* run_analysis.R: script in R that perform analyses to merge, tidy and 
summarise input data
* CodeBook.md: describe the variables and dataframes
